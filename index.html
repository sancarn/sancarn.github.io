        Hello there, currently this is a work in progress page. I've tried to keep the page as simple as
        possible for now and will make it more fancy later.
    </p>
    <p>
        To give a brief overview of this site, my name is James Warren aka "Sancarn", and I'm a software
        dev. I'm pretty API focussed and spend a large amount of 'out of work' hours building libraries 
        to make tasks easier 'inside work' hours. Because I believe many of the things I do are fairly
        unique, I open source a lot of the libraries I build, as I'm sure these will be useful for others.
    </p>

      Note:<br>
      All libraries I release are utility libraries only and do not contain any proprietry code.
    </pre>

      Without further ado, here are the current links I have set up.
